# RoboAdvisor Project

This project is aimed at developing a simple RoboAdvisor system using Python. The RoboAdvisor provides basic analysis and visualization of stock data for selected companies, allowing users to make informed decisions about their investments.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Collection**: Data is collected from Yahoo Finance using the `pandas_datareader` library. Stock data for specific companies, such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), is retrieved for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**: Various plots and visualizations are created to analyze the stock data, including candlestick charts, moving averages, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) plots.

3. **Trend Analysis**: The project includes functions to analyze trends in stock prices and identify patterns using techniques such as seasonal decomposition and trend line analysis.

4. **User Interaction**: The RoboAdvisor system interacts with the user by presenting visualizations and asking for input based on the analysis. Users can make decisions about stock performance based on the provided information.
